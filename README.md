# 🌦️ Telangana Weather Insights Dashboard (2021–2024)

## 📘 Overview
The **Telangana Weather Insights Dashboard** is a Power BI–based analytical project designed to visualize and analyze 4 years (2021–2024) of district-wise weather data across Telangana, India.  
It provides a comprehensive look at **rainfall, temperature, humidity, and wind speed**, helping identify trends, anomalies, and climate patterns across regions.

The dataset was compiled from **36+ monthly CSV files (≈705K records)** and cleaned, merged, and transformed using Power Query before creating dynamic, interactive dashboards in Power BI.

## 🧮 Key DAX Measures

```DAX
-- Total Rainfall
Total Rainfall (mm) = SUM('Weather'[Rain (mm)])

-- Average Temperature
Avg Temperature (°C) = AVERAGE( ('Weather'[Max Temp (°C)] + 'Weather'[Min Temp (°C)]) / 2 )

-- Daily Temperature Range
Daily Temp Range (°C) = AVERAGE('Weather'[Max Temp (°C)] - 'Weather'[Min Temp (°C)])

-- Average Humidity
Avg Humidity (%) = AVERAGE(('Weather'[Max Humidity (%)] + 'Weather'[Min Humidity (%)]) / 2)

-- Average Wind Speed
Avg Wind Speed (Kmph) = AVERAGE(('Weather'[Max Wind Speed (Kmph)] + 'Weather'[Min Wind Speed (Kmph)]) / 2)
